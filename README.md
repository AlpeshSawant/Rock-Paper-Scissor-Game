The project Rock, Paper, Scissor game is developed by using Html/CSS and JavaScript Technology.
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.
